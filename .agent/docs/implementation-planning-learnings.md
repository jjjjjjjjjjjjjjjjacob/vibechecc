# Implementation Planning Learnings

## Overview

This document captures learnings from creating and organizing comprehensive implementation plans for the vibechecc project.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Task Grouping Strategy

- **Group by functional area** rather than by technical implementation
- **Related features should be in the same plan** to ensure consistency
- Example: All rating-related features (fixes, likes, sharing) belong in `rating-review-improvements.md`

### 2. Plan Structure Best Practices

Each implementation plan should include:

- **Overview** - High-level summary of what's being addressed
- **Current System Analysis** - Understanding existing code before changes
- **Implementation Steps** - Specific file paths and code changes
- **Testing Requirements** - Functional, performance, and UX testing
- **Implementation Phases** - Logical grouping and dependencies
- **Risk Assessment** - Identify potential breaking changes
- **Success Metrics** - Measurable outcomes
- **Dependencies** - External libraries, services, or prerequisites
- **Timeline Estimates** - Realistic effort estimates

### 3. File Organization

```
.agent/plans/
├── ui-ux-improvements.md          # UI/UX and mobile improvements
├── social-community-features.md   # Social features, leaderboards, trophies
├── rating-review-improvements.md  # Rating system (includes likes, sharing)
├── auth-onboarding-improvements.md # Authentication and onboarding
├── discovery-recommendations.md   # Discovery and recommendation algorithms
├── technical-fixes.md            # Infrastructure and technical issues
└── marketing-strategy.md         # User acquisition (separate concern)
```

### 4. Cross-Referencing

- **Update `.agent/rules.md`** to reference all implementation plans
- **Keep plan names descriptive** but concise
- **Group similar features** to avoid plan proliferation

### 5. Code Examples in Plans

- **Include specific TypeScript/React code** where helpful
- **Reference exact file paths** from the monorepo structure
- **Show before/after for modifications**
- **Include new component structures** for additions

### 6. Monorepo Considerations

- **Always specify workspace** (apps/web, apps/convex, packages/\*)
- **Consider shared dependencies** in packages/types and packages/utils
- **Account for Nx task dependencies** in implementation order

### 7. Feature Completeness

Ensure each feature covers:

- Database schema changes
- Backend functions (queries, mutations, actions)
- Frontend components and hooks
- UI/UX considerations
- Performance implications
- Testing approach

### 8. Progress Tracking

- **Mark completed sections** as work progresses
- **Update learnings** after implementation
- **Document blockers or changes** to original plan

## When to Use This Reference

### Creating New Plans

- When adding major features not covered by existing plans
- When technical debt requires systematic remediation
- When user feedback necessitates comprehensive changes

### Updating Existing Plans

- When discovering missing functionality (like rating likes)
- When implementation reveals better approaches
- When dependencies or requirements change

### During Implementation

- Reference plan before starting each phase
- Update progress markers as tasks complete
- Document deviations or improvements

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-fragmentation** - Don't create too many small plans
2. **Under-specification** - Include enough detail for implementation
3. **Ignoring dependencies** - Check cross-plan dependencies
4. **Skipping analysis** - Always analyze current system first
5. **Unrealistic timelines** - Account for testing and iteration

## Success Indicators

- Implementation follows plan with minimal deviations
- Testing requirements catch issues before production
- Timeline estimates prove accurate within 20%
- Success metrics are measurable and achieved
- Future work can reference and build on plans

## Agent Usage Notes

When an AI agent is asked to work on features:

1. **Check `.agent/plans/` first** for existing implementation plans
2. **Follow the established plan** if one exists
3. **Update progress markers** as work completes
4. **Document learnings** for future agents
5. **Create new plans** only for uncovered major features

This systematic approach ensures consistent, high-quality implementation across the entire vibechecc platform.
