# Sunset Circle Rating System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from the circle rating system to an emoji-only rating system, removing all circle/star rating functionality and updating the UI to focus exclusively on emoji ratings with required reviews.

## Major Changes

### 1. Rating System Updates
- **Removed**: Circle/star rating system completely removed
- **Updated**: All ratings now require emoji selection and written review (50+ character minimum)
- **Changed**: "Rate This Vibe" â†’ "Rate & Review This Vibe" throughout the app

### 2. Vibe Detail Page Changes
- Removed dual rating buttons (Rate with Review / Rate with Emoji)
- Single "Rate & Review" button that opens emoji rating popover
- Removed quick rating section with circle ratings
- Removed average star rating display below title
- Reviews section now shows CTA when empty: "No written reviews yet. Be the first to review this vibe!"

### 3. Vibe Card Updates
- Removed fallback to StarRatingWithPopover when no emoji ratings exist
- Vibes without emoji ratings no longer show any rating UI
- Emoji ratings always show with 5-icon scale visualization
- Fixed partial emoji display to show exact decimal (e.g., 3.7 shows 70% of 4th emoji)

### 4. Emoji Rating Display Improvements
- Increased opacity of background emojis from 0.2 to 0.3 for better visibility
- Fixed partial emoji clipping to show exact percentage
- Added "X.X out of 5" format with rating count
- Scale always visible when requested (not just on hover)
