# .agent Directory

This directory contains AI assistant documentation and learnings to improve development workflows.

## Structure

```
.agent/
├── README.md              # This file
├── docs/                  # Workspace-specific learnings and documentation
│   ├── web-learnings.md   # Frontend development insights
│   └── convex-learnings.md # Backend development insights
└── rules.md               # Project-specific AI assistant rules
```

## Purpose

The `.agent/` directory serves as a knowledge base for AI assistants working on this codebase. It contains:

1. **Learnings**: Documented insights from completed tasks that help future development
2. **Rules**: Project-specific guidelines that override default AI behavior
3. **Context**: Important context about the codebase architecture and conventions

## Usage

When working with AI assistants:

1. Check relevant learnings files before starting a task
2. Follow the rules defined in `rules.md`
3. Update learnings after completing significant tasks
4. Document any gotchas or non-obvious patterns discovered

## Contributing

When adding to this directory:

- Keep learnings specific and actionable
- Include code examples where helpful
- Label the situations where each learning applies
- Update existing content rather than duplicating
