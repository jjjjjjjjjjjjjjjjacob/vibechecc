# Always Ask for Clarification When Uncertain

## Rule
When there is ANY ambiguity or potential confusion in terminology, requirements, or implementation details, ALWAYS ask for clarification before proceeding with changes.

## Common Areas Requiring Clarification

### UI Terminology
- **Expanded/Collapsed States**: Modal states vs tab names vs view states
  - "Expanded tab" = A tab labeled 'expanded' 
  - "Expanded view" = Full-screen maximized modal
  - "Collapsed view" = Normal modal view
  - "Minimal tab" = A tab labeled 'minimal'

### Component Hierarchy
- Parent vs child components
- Wrapper components vs nested components
- Which specific instance when multiple exist

### Behavioral Requirements  
- Should behavior apply to all instances or specific ones?
- Are changes additive or replacements?
- What are the edge cases?

## Examples of Good Clarification Questions
- "I see there are two concepts here: tabs labeled 'expanded'/'minimal' and view states (maximized/minimized). Which are you referring to?"
- "Should this apply to all three instances or just the first one?"
- "Do you want this behavior only when X condition is met, or always?"

## Why This Matters
- Prevents incorrect implementations
- Saves time by avoiding rework
- Ensures user requirements are met accurately
- Reduces frustration for both parties

## Implementation
Before making changes when ANY uncertainty exists:
1. State what you understand
2. Identify the ambiguity
3. Ask specific clarifying questions
4. Wait for confirmation before proceeding
