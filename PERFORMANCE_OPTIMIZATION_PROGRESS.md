## üìù Implementation Notes

### Search Logging Fix Strategy

The redundant search logging happens because:

1. `search.tsx` creates two `useSearchResultsImproved` instances
2. Each instance has its own `useEffect` hooks that track searches
3. Both fire when the query changes

Solution:

- Extract search tracking to a separate context/hook
- Share tracking state between components
- Implement proper debouncing and deduplication

### N+1 Query Fix Strategy

Current implementation in `vibes.ts`:

- Lines 154-180: Individual rating queries per vibe
- Lines 330-365: Nested user lookups for each rating
- Lines 392-429: Duplicate pattern in pagination

Solution:

- Batch fetch all users in one query
- Pre-aggregate ratings data
- Use Map for O(1) user lookups

### Optimization Scripts Added

1. **analyze-bundle-enhanced.js** - Comprehensive bundle analysis
2. **optimize-icon-imports.js** - Automated icon import optimization
3. **optimize-bundle.js** - Full optimization runner
4. **optimize-code-splitting.js** - Code splitting recommendations
5. **Virtual scrolling components** - For large lists and tables

### Available Commands

```bash
# Analysis
bun run bundle:analyze              # Enhanced bundle analysis
bun run bundle:analyze:splitting    # Code splitting recommendations

# Optimization
bun run bundle:optimize             # Complete optimization
bun run bundle:optimize:icons      # Icon import optimization
```
