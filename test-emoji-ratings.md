   - Expanded mode: Shows emoji with "out of 5" text, scale visualization, and tags
   - Smooth animations using framer-motion
   - Hover effects including emoji rotation and scale animations
   - Support for partial ratings (e.g., 3.5 out of 5)

2. **Updated VIbeCard Component** (`/apps/web/src/features/vibes/components/vibe-card.tsx`)
   - Replaced star ratings with emoji ratings when reactions exist
   - Added expand/collapse functionality for multiple emoji ratings
   - Shows most-interacted emoji as primary rating
   - Maintains backward compatibility - shows stars when no emoji ratings exist
   - Added expandable emoji ratings section after reactions

3. **Updated Vibe Detail Page** (`/apps/web/src/routes/vibes/$vibeId.tsx`)
   - Prominent emoji rating display next to title
   - "Top Emoji Ratings" section showing all emoji ratings
   - Updated review cards to show emoji ratings when available
   - Falls back to star ratings for reviews without emoji ratings

### Key Features:

- Smooth spring animations on hover and interaction
- Responsive design that works in both card and detail views
- Backward compatible with existing star rating system

### Integration with Other Threads:

- Thread 1 (Backend): Components ready to receive real emoji rating data
- Thread 2 (Popovers): Visual components ready to display ratings created via popovers

### Next Steps for Full Integration:

1. Connect to real backend data when Thread 1 completes
2. Replace simulated rating values with actual data from database
3. Wire up emoji rating creation from Thread 2's popover components
