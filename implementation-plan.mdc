# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Rating & Review System

## Overview
Transform the rating and review system to be more like Letterboxd/Beli/Goodreads, where:
- Users are prompted to submit a review with each rating
- Emoji reactions can be used as ratings (e.g., 3 ðŸ˜³ out of 5)
- Clicking on a rating opens a popover for rating/reviewing
- Clicking on a reaction opens a popover for emoji-rating
- Vibes display their most-interacted emoji reaction as the primary visual
- Expanded view shows top emoji ratings

## Technical Considerations

### Component Architecture
```
RatingPopover
â”œâ”€â”€ StarRatingSelector
â”œâ”€â”€ EmojiRatingToggle
â”œâ”€â”€ ReviewTextarea (required)
â””â”€â”€ SubmitButton

EmojiRatingPopover
â”œâ”€â”€ EmojiPicker
â”œâ”€â”€ RatingScaleSelector (1-5)
â”œâ”€â”€ TagDisplay
â”œâ”€â”€ ReviewTextarea (required)
â””â”€â”€ SubmitButton
```

### State Management
- Use TanStack Query for rating data
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Local state for popover forms
- Global state for user's ratings cache

### Performance
- Lazy load emoji metadata
- Cache most-interacted emojis
- Debounce rating updates
- Use virtual scrolling for emoji lists

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation for popovers
- Screen reader support for emoji ratings
- Alternative text for emoji displays
- Focus management in popovers

## Integration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

### What's Now Working:
1. **Emoji Rating System**
   - Users can rate vibes with both traditional stars and emoji ratings
   - Two new popover components: RatingPopover and EmojiRatingPopover
   - Required 50-character minimum reviews to encourage quality feedback
   - Real-time emoji metadata from backend with tags and categories

2. **Backend Integration**
   - RatingPopover submits to `api.vibes.addRating` with optional emoji support
   - EmojiRatingPopover uses `api.emojiRatings.createOrUpdateEmojiRating`
   - Emoji metadata loaded from backend `emojiRatingMetadata` table
   - All mutations include proper error handling and loading states

3. **User Experience**
   - Clean popover interfaces for both rating types
   - Visual emoji scale (1-5) with filled/unfilled emojis
   - Character counter with real-time validation
   - Toast notifications for successful submissions
   - Accessible with full keyboard navigation

### Components Created:
- `/apps/web/src/components/rating-popover.tsx`
- `/apps/web/src/components/emoji-rating-popover.tsx`
- `/apps/web/src/components/emoji-rating-display.tsx` (enhanced)

### Remaining Work (Phase 4 & 5):
- Update vibe cards to show most-interacted emoji ratings
- Add emoji rating filtering and sorting
- Implement user profile rating history
- Add analytics for emoji rating trends

## Thread 2 Completion Notes (Agent #2)

### What Was Completed
- âœ… Created `RatingPopover` component with star rating, required review (50 char min), and emoji toggle
- âœ… Created `EmojiRatingPopover` with emoji picker, 1-5 scale visualization, and tag display
- âœ… Implemented form validation, error handling, and loading states for both components
- âœ… Added accessibility features including ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- âœ… Components use existing UI primitives (Popover, Command, Button, Textarea, Label)

### Integration Notes for Next Steps
1. **Backend Integration**: Components accept async `onSubmit` handlers - connect to real mutations when Thread 1 completes
2. **Emoji Metadata**: Replace mock `RATING_EMOJI_METADATA` with data from backend `emojiRatingMetadata` table
3. **Component Updates**: 
   - Modify `StarRating` to optionally open `RatingPopover` on click (Phase 3.3)
   - Update `EmojiReaction` to support rating mode that opens `EmojiRatingPopover`
4. **Visual Integration**: Use components in vibe cards and detail pages (Phase 4)

### Key Design Decisions
- Used checkbox instead of Switch (doesn't exist in codebase)
- 50 character minimum for reviews to encourage quality feedback
- Components are data-agnostic and accept callbacks
- Form state is local to each popover component
