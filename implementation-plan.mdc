## Coordination & Guidelines

### Shared Dependencies
- **Types**: `@vibechecc/types` for all TypeScript interfaces
- **API**: `api.search.*` namespace for backend functions
- **Components**: Reuse existing shadcn/ui components

### Working Order
1. All agents can work in parallel
2. Agent 1 should prioritize hook updates (others may need them)
3. Agent 2 can start with either backend or frontend
4. Agent 3 can begin testing existing components

### Quality Standards
- Run `bun run quality` before marking complete
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Test edge cases (special chars, long queries)
- Verify < 200ms response time
- Check keyboard accessibility

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Fuzzy search handles typos gracefully
- [ ] Filters work smoothly on mobile
- [ ] All tests pass with > 80% coverage
- [ ] Search responds in < 200ms
- [ ] URLs are shareable with filters
- [ ] Analytics provide usage insights

### Communication
- Update this plan as you complete tasks
- Note any API changes that affect other agents
- Test integration points between agent work
- Document any blockers or dependencies
