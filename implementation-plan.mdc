# VibeChecc Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the VibeChecc application, which leverages a modern, full-stack architecture. The plan is organized into phases, starting from the foundational infrastructure setup to the final deployment and documentation.

## Current Focus: Creating Developer Documentation

Our immediate goal is to create comprehensive documentation for local development, cloud deployment, and dependency management.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **[Done]** Finalize the Cloudflare Workers deployment workflow in GitHub Actions.
2.  **[In Progress]** Create a detailed `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` guide.
3.  **[In Progress]** Write a `CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT.md` guide explaining the CI/CD process.
4.  **[In Progress]** Document dependency management in `DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md`.
5.  **[In Progress]** Update the main `README.md` to provide a high-level overview and link to the new documentation.
