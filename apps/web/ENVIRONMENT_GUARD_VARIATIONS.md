# Environment Access Guard Variations

This document explains the three variations of the environment-access-guard component, each with different approaches to theme detection and application.

## Overview

All three variations handle:

- ✅ Environment access control via PostHog feature flags
- ✅ Theme detection from localStorage or system preferences
- ✅ Smooth fade transitions
- ✅ Cloudflare Workers compatibility

The key difference is **how and when** they detect and apply themes.

## Version 1: Immediate Theme Detection (`environment-access-guard-v1.tsx`)

### Approach

- **Immediate detection**: Reads localStorage and applies theme synchronously on mount
- **Simple fallback**: Falls back to system preference if no localStorage data
- **Direct application**: Applies theme classes immediately to the DOM

### Behavior

- ✅ **No theme flash**: Theme is applied immediately
- ✅ **Fast rendering**: No waiting for theme initialization
- ❌ **No progressive enhancement**: Single detection attempt

### Best For

- Simple applications where theme detection needs to be instant
- When you want minimal complexity and guaranteed no theme flash

### Code Example

```tsx
// Detects and applies theme immediately
const detectTheme = () => {
  const savedThemeData = localStorage.getItem('theme-storage');
  if (savedThemeData) {
    // Use saved theme
  } else {
    // Use system preference
  }
  // Apply immediately to DOM
};
```

## Version 2: Adaptive Theme with Fallback (`environment-access-guard-v2.tsx`)

### Approach

- **Adaptive behavior**: Different defaults for first-time vs returning users
- **Enhanced fallback**: Provides default color themes for new users
- **System listener**: Listens for system theme changes if no localStorage
- **Ready state**: Waits for theme to be fully configured before showing content

### Behavior

- ✅ **Smart defaults**: New users get nice default color schemes
- ✅ **System adaptation**: Follows system theme changes for new users
- ✅ **Enhanced UX**: Shows welcome message for new users
- ❌ **Slight delay**: Waits for theme ready state

### Features

- **New users**: Get purple/pink themes for dark mode, blue/emerald for light mode
- **Returning users**: Use their saved preferences
- **System tracking**: Automatically follows system theme changes for users without preferences

### Best For

- Applications that want to provide a great first-time user experience
- When you want smart defaults that look good out of the box
- User onboarding scenarios

### Code Example

```tsx
// Provides enhanced defaults for new users
if (!hasLocalStorage) {
  if (mode === 'dark') {
    colorTheme = 'purple-primary';
    secondaryColorTheme = 'pink-secondary';
  } else {
    colorTheme = 'blue-primary';
    secondaryColorTheme = 'emerald-secondary';
  }
}
```

## Version 3: Smart Progressive Enhancement (`environment-access-guard-v3.tsx`)

### Approach

- **Progressive enhancement**: Shows system theme immediately, then enhances with localStorage
- **Multi-step loading**:
  1. Instant system theme application
  2. Asynchronous localStorage check
  3. Theme enhancement if saved preferences exist
- **Source tracking**: Tracks where the theme came from (system/localStorage/default)
- **Smooth transitions**: Handles theme transitions gracefully

### Behavior

- ✅ **Instant display**: System theme applied immediately (0ms delay)
- ✅ **Progressive enhancement**: Saved preferences applied smoothly after
- ✅ **Smooth transitions**: CSS transitions between theme changes
- ✅ **Transparent UX**: Users see appropriate loading messages

### Features

- **Immediate rendering**: System theme with default colors applied instantly
- **Smart enhancement**: localStorage preferences applied with smooth transitions
- **Debug info**: Shows theme source in access denied screen
- **Transition messages**: Different loading messages based on theme source

### Best For

- Performance-critical applications
- When you want the absolute fastest initial render
- Progressive web apps that need to feel instant
- Applications where theme changes should be smooth and transparent

### Code Example

```tsx
// Step 1: Immediate system theme
const systemMode = getSystemTheme();
applyThemeToDocument(initialConfig);

// Step 2: Async localStorage enhancement
const checkLocalStorage = async () => {
  const savedThemeData = localStorage.getItem('theme-storage');
  if (savedThemeData) {
    // Enhance with saved preferences
    applyThemeToDocument(enhancedConfig);
  }
};
```

## Migration Notes

All three versions are **drop-in replacements** for the original component. Simply change the import:

```tsx
// Original
import { EnvironmentAccessGuard } from '@/components/environment-access-guard';

// Version 1
import { EnvironmentAccessGuardV1 as EnvironmentAccessGuard } from '@/components/environment-access-guard-v1';

// Version 2
import { EnvironmentAccessGuardV2 as EnvironmentAccessGuard } from '@/components/environment-access-guard-v2';

// Version 3
import { EnvironmentAccessGuardV3 as EnvironmentAccessGuard } from '@/components/environment-access-guard-v3';
```

The API is identical across all versions.
