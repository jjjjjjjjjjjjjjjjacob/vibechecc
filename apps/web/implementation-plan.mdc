# Apps/Web Monorepo Refactor Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Refactor the `apps/web/` directory for better component organization, test coverage, and developer experience

**Current State**:
- 160+ React components across `/components/` and `/features/`
- 10.6% test coverage (17 tests for 160 components)
- Component duplicates and organizational issues
- Non-shadcn components mixed in `ui/` directory

**Target State**:
- Clean feature-based component organization
- 70%+ test coverage
- Comprehensive developer documentation
- Clear separation of UI primitives vs application components

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis & Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Audit current component structure
- [x] Identify test coverage gaps  
- [x] Assess documentation needs
- [x] Create implementation plan (this document)
- [x] Document findings in `.agent/docs/web-refactor-learnings.md`

### Phase 2: Component Organization ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### 2.1 Resolve Component Duplicates ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **create-vibe-button.tsx**: Removed `/components/` version, kept `/features/vibes/components/` version

- [x] **vibe-grid.tsx**: Merged functionality, kept comprehensive version in features directory
- [x] **vibe-placeholder.tsx**: Removed all unused duplicates completely
- [x] Updated all import references across the codebase (40+ imports fixed)

#### 2.2 Clean UI Directory ‚úÖ COMPLETED
Moved all NON-SHADCN components out of `/components/ui/`:

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Breaking Changes**: Moving components may break imports
   - **Mitigation**: Update all imports atomically, use IDE refactoring tools

2. **Test Complexity**: Some components may be hard to test
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simpler components, build testing patterns gradually

3. **Scope Creep**: Refactor becoming too large
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on high-impact changes first, document remaining work

### Rollback Plan
- Keep detailed commit history for each phase
- Maintain working state after each major change
- Use feature flags if needed for gradual rollout

## Progress Tracking

**Current Phase**: Phases 3 & 4 (Testing & Documentation) - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**Current Status**: Complete Monorepo Refactor Successfully Finished üéâ
**Next Phase**: Optional enhancements (vibe-card testing, additional component tests)
